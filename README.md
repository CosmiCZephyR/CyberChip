## Dependencies

As there is no easy way to unzip files in GDScript, this plugin uses [Ouch!](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) to decompress Wakatime CLI right from the Github page.

But there is no need to manually download it as the Godot Wakatime plugin automatically downloads, uses and deletes as needed


## Installation

The easiest and fastest way is to install directly from Godot's AssetLib

1. Access Godot's AssetLib inside the engine (`F4` default keybind)
2. Search for `godot-wakatime` and click on install button

Or, you can manually install the latest version following the next steps

1. Download and extract latest zip file from [**releases**](https://github.com/thomazthz/godot-wakatime/releases).
2. Copy or move the `wakatime` directory from the extracted zip and put into your project's `addons` directory. Create the `addons` directory at the root of your project if you don't have one.


### Activation

- Activate `godot-wakatime` on Plugins tab at menu `Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins`.
- Enter your Wakatime API Key on the opened prompt.
- Use Godot script editor for a while and check on https://wakatime.com/api/v1/users/current or https://wakatime.com/dashboard to see your coding activity :)


## Configuration

**Godot WakaTime >=1.5.0**

From version 1.5.0 this plugin started to use the global WakaTime config file (`$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.cfg`) which can be opened in the `Project -> Tools -> Wakatime Config File` menu item.

You can enter or replace your API key in the menu item `Project -> Tools -> Wakatime API key`.

More information about the available settings can be found in [wakatime-cli usage page](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli/blob/develop/USAGE.md)

---

**Godot WakaTime < 1.5.0**

In versions prior to 1.5.0 the plugin uses a local configuration file located at `res://addons/wakatime/settings.cfg`.

Some settings are available in the editor bottom panel as soon as the plugin is active
